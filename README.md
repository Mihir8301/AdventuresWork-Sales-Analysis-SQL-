# AdventuresWork-Sales-Analysis-SQL-
In this AdventureWorks sales data analysis, I initiated the project by extracting, cleaning, and thoroughly analyzing the dataset using SQL. The objective was to unveil valuable insights to address specific business challenges. The comprehensive findings derived from the analysis were meticulously translated into a dynamic Power BI dashboard. This dashboard serves as a visually intuitive and interactive tool, providing stakeholders with the means to gain actionable insights into sales performance. It equips decision-makers with the information needed to optimize business strategies, fostering informed and effective decision-making.
