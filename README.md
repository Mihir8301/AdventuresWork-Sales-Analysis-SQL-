# AdventuresWork-Sales-Analysis-SQL-
In this AdventureWorks sales data analysis, I initiated the project by extracting, cleaning, and thoroughly analyzing the dataset using SQL. The objective was to unveil valuable insights to address specific business challenges. The comprehensive findings derived from the analysis were meticulously translated into a dynamic Power BI dashboard. This dashboard serves as a visually intuitive and interactive tool, providing stakeholders with the means to gain actionable insights into sales performance. It equips decision-makers with the information needed to optimize business strategies, fostering informed and effective decision-making.

# Business Requirements 
We need to improve our internet sales reports and need to have a visual dashboards. Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time. We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance. The budget is for 2023 and we usually look 2 years back (i.e. 2021 and 2022) in time when we do analysis of sales.
